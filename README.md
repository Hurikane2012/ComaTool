# ComaTool
A tool for people that stream to YouTube and Twitch at the same time, allowing for YouTube chat to use twitch commands such as !bsr.
It also generates a txt file saying that someone on YouTube requested with !bsr which is useful for obs.
As of now it requires use of sensitive information. I am sorry about that, but i will be working on a way to run this without the use of private info.
Until then, don't use any forks of this project for safety reasons.
